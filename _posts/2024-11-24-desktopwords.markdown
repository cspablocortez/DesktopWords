I was going to call this post _Blogging in 2024_ to talk about
how difficult and confusing it is to set up a blog, especially 
if you're not very tech-savvy. 

Earlier this year I wrote about Giles Turnbull's thoughts on 
[gilest.org](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html) 
about independent web publishing. He writes:

> We need more self-hosted platforms for personal publishing 
that aren’t Wordpress. And don’t point me to Hugo or Netlify or Eleventy 
or all those things - all of them are great, but none of them are simple enough. 
We need web publishing tools that do not require users to open the Terminal 
at all. And we need lots of them.

That's a tall order.

The constant effort towards simplifying computer software has made web browsers 
the most popular app on our computers. While there will always
be a need for specialized software, it's sometimes easier to search for a 
_background remover_ on Google than to open up the photos app on my laptop. 

I admire anyone who chooses to self-host their website, because it's no small
effort. I _love_ developing websites from scratch. 

## Writing

When I want to start a new article, I open TextMate on my computer and create
a new file. I save the file with the name `2024-11-24-blogging_today.markdown`
and I start writing.

The part enclosed between the three dashes is called Front Matter. It's 
a type of data format recognized by Jekyll, the next program in my process. 
Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes the files that
make up this website, processes them to apply styles like fonts and colors, 
and outputs a single folder. That folder is my final website, ready to be 
published somewhere.

## Publishing


### Git

The next step is knowing where and how to publish. As a web developer I'm aware of 
sites like Github Pages because I use yet another program called git to keep track
of the changes I make to the files on my website. Let's say that I start
writing a sentence about ~~dogs~~ cats. But after a while I feel compelled to 
talk about cats instead and now I go and replace every instance of the word on
my manuscript, leaving a small note explaining the change. At any point in time I can
access a detailed report of the changes and the reasoning behind them. That's what
git does for programmers. It's a powerful version control system. I access this
program through the Terminal. My process already breaks the first prerequisite 
of an accessible self-hosting method. 

### The Terminal

The terminal is a program that gives me convenient access to the filesystem. 
If you need to create twelve folders for every month of the year to keep your
writing organized, it's easier to type a command than to click through endless
menus.

If I wasn't a developer, I wouldn't want to spend my time learning a tool 
to manage another tool that makes working with another tool that much
better. As a writer, I want to write. Passing a note in grade school didn't 
require an understanding of graphite scaling. Likewise, Blogging shouldn't 
require an understanding of version control sytems.

## Blogs

I read blogs to learn from others and because I like stories. In 1991, a bit
before the Web was introduced, a team at the University of Minnesota created
a software called Gopher. This program was accessible from a terminal like the 
one above. You'd visit directories (i.e., folders on a computer) and see a 
list of its contents.

People soon began to create sites where they could share their writing, like
an early form of blogging, although that word came after the web was introduced, as blog
is short for _web_ + log.

On Gopher there is a user called nm03 that has a site (they call them gopherholes)
at `gopher://gopher.club/1/users/nm03`. He calls it _nm03's gopher hole in Tokyo, Japan_.

His about page reads:

> I live in Tokyo, Japan.
> I have done a number of life resets.
> I have taken one full trip around the world.
> I guess you could say I am trilingual. 

> I stared using Gopher in 1995 and I am glad to be back

I started reading nm03 in 2019, and now it's become a thing I do. I've read about
his side hobbies, pet projects, updates on Tokyo weather, visits back to the USA
and the subsequent culture shock. I came across his site while learning to
use Gopher, since you need specialized software to access it. Notice how the first part of 
his site address doesn't start with `https://`? 

Right now we are using a totally different protocol called the 
HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP or The Web for short.
