    <summary>Who are you?</summary>

        <p>Hi! My name is Pablo. I'm a writer and web developer from Las Vegas.</p>

    <summary>What's the story behind the website name?</summary>
    <main style="padding: 1rem;">
        <p>On Sunday November 24 2024, I wrote on my blog:</p>
        <blockquote>I bought the desktopwords domain from Porkbun for $10.06 this morning.</blockquote>
        <p>During the summer of 2024 I was working on developing a web app for managing the references and links I came across while doing research for my thesis. This app was later repurposed and became a blogging platform in its own right, where "blogging" means "web logging", as in accumulating content from around the web, like a digital scrapbook.</p>
        <p>As time went by, I decided I wanted a space where I could write longform content without the overhead of a "profile" or an online presence defined by my name.</p>
        <p>You know how some people exclusively buy airplane tickets from their computers because it's not a "phone" activity? For me, writing is a desktop activity. I wanted a place where I could publish the type of writing I produce when I sit at my desk. Hence, desktop words. This writing isn't really serious, but it's certainly something I spend more time editing than a quick text message or tweet.</p>

    <summary>Why does the website look like it's just HTML?</summary>
    <main style="padding: 1rem;">
        <p>I am both a writer and a web developer, and that means I'm someone who loves obsessing over typography, accessibility, fonts, styling, margins, padding... you get the point.</p>
        <p>Most times this is a distraction, as I end up spending too much time tweaking elements and styles on a website rather than writing.</p>
        <p>For this website I'm using a Jekyll theme I developed called <a href="https://cspablocortez.github.io/arrow-jekyll-theme/">Arrow</a>. It features minimal CSS by relying on default browser stylesheets to produce highly readable, responsive websites and blogs. You can learn more about it and check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/cspablocortez/arrow-jekyll-theme">here</a>.</p>
